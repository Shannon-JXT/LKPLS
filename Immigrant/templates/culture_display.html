                            <li>Australians love taking nature strips as gifts. When they think they have something which are not used anymore, they just chuck it on the grass in front of their houses. If someone who happens to be passing by and finds it interesting, those dumped things are free to grab. However, the government might not like it.</li>
                            <li>Australians take the front seat. Considering themselves as egalitarians, every time they pick a taxi, it is highly likely they will sit next to the driver. You might find it unusual in your country or in the US movies.</li>
                            <li>Being an Australian	and sports are two unseparated things. The obsession of sports, especially for Australian Football, is well-known. It is like a religion celebration.</li>
                            <li>Australians have their own reasons to take days-off. It is like taking days-off is a right that has been wired to their bone for any literally reason. They take days-off not only for religious or public holidays, but also feeling a bit sick, having a weekday before/after weekend and there is a religious/public holiday on the other side of it, the fake birthday of a Queen, missing the train, needing a haircut, or a football game being on tomorrow.</li>
                            <li>Australians are Larrikins. There are many definitions of Larrikins of Australia in the internet. There is no standard or convention about the definition, but Australians definitely are.</li>
